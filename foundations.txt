At the foundation level of this project, there needs to be a way to take text, record it, and then link to it.

The 2 biggest problems in computer science as I understand them are

  naming things
  
  cache invalidation
  
  off by one errors
  
It is my understanding that I can skip the first 2 by the following steps

  never name things - use their cryptographic hash to refer to them, in a manner like git, et al
  
  in order to deal with time / spacetime / all things timey/whimey, I'll use an idea that appears to be absurd on the surface, but should prove to be quite useful once implemented... immutable text
  
  yes, that's right... you can never, EVER change the text once it's put in the buffer, it remains, and becomes part of a version of the text at that point in spacetime. You can, however, build a new version that makes modifications to it, much in the same manner as git (notice a theme?)
